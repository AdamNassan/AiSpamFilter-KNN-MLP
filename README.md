# AiSpamFilter-KNN-MLP
The project is to build a spam filter using two different machine learning models: k-nearest neighbors (KNN) and multilayer perceptron (MLP). 
The KNN model is a simple and efficient algorithm that works by finding the k most similar training examples to a new example and predicting the label of the new example based on the labels of the k nearest neighbors.
 The MLP model is a more complex algorithm that uses artificial neural networks to learn the relationship between the features of the training examples and their labels.
The project evaluated using the following metrics: accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. Accuracy is the fraction of test examples that are correctly classified. Precision is the fraction of predicted positive examples that are actually positive. Recall is the fraction of actual positive examples that are correctly classified. F1-score is a measure of both precision and recall.
In addition to that we find the conflict matrix is a useful tool for understanding the relationship between different features in a dataset. It help me to identify potential problems in your data and to make better decisions about how to model it.
The project implemented in Python using the NumPy, SciPy, and Scikit-learn libraries. The project evaluated on a dataset of spam and ham emails.
The results of the project are to build a spam filter that achieves high accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. The project also provide insights into the performance of the two machine learning models.
